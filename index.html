The first few topics might be a bit theoretical and I'll try to skip fast while keeping in mind that you get these basics about the Internet. There are common misconceptions about the Internet that'd be cleared. Also sometimes in between, I'd be marking portions of code segment as above, and explaining it. Pay careful attention in these areas. At the same time, in the middle of the blogposts, since I love diverting off, I might throw in a few advanced topics which might seem interesting in the flow.

                    <h2 class="content-subhead" id="day2">Day 2 - Introduction to the WEB.</h2>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        Well, we have computers and we have the internet because of which you are able to see this post. So let me start off with the most obvious start to the topic. What is the internet ? Well, the internet is an interconnected network of computers, that's all you have to be knowing as of now. I'll skip all the boring information, you can always catch up with that information <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" target="_blank">here.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">So how does the internet work ? What is so special about the internet ? What really happens in the internet ? What is the exact meaning of <code>https://www.google.com/</code> ? <br> Well before we answer all the above questions, lets have a look at a few basics of computers and the web technology as a whole. To do the web development, you don't really need to be knowing who created it first and all as of now, but if you're interested, you can always Google it up. <br>
                    So, we all know what the URL Bar of a browser is, I'll be using Firefox to be showing you the demos.<br></p>
                    <img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ICFAW5tOTpA/UZRZ1ugfiFI/AAAAAAAAAGo/1_aAskDH4hc/s640/urlbar.JPG" alt="URL Bar Image Loading">
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">What we type out in the URL(Uniform Resource Locator) bar is called a client query. There are two things here, whats a client and whats a server ? A client is a computer that requests information from another computer. A server is a computer that provides you with the information. So think about it ... Can a client be a server ? Can a server be a client ?</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">So, what happens when we do a query for Google's homepage. the typed <code>www.google.com</code> gets converted to an IP address, something like <code>74.125.236.179</code></p>
                    <img src="3.bp.blogspot.com/-gO96yAli6Js/UZRlISjFnTI/AAAAAAAAAG4/Ma42GjPwK6c/s1600/ipaddress.JPG" alt="IP Address Image Loading">
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">This number differs based on your closest Google server and their server load, i.e. simultaneous number of people requesting the same page, so instead of typing in www.google.com, if you type in 74.125.236.179 , it'll still take you to the google homepage. This is because the URL is a human readable format of these numbers and each of these names is called a 'Domain Name'. There is a system of naming called DNS which doesn't allow the same name to be taken over, so you can't register your website over an already registered domain name, like google.com. Getting back to where we were, as you type the domain name, it gets converted to an IP address which is computer understandable, this then asks the root servers (the main servers which keep a list of domain names and their connecting numbers), it receives an IP address corresponding to its query. So the computer then calls this computer, this computer(server) then understands the call and sends back the required files to be shown. The medium which makes this connections possible and content viewable are the internet browsers like Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">For those interested in how this connections take place and processes involved, look at a more advanced thing called layers, the approximate working is denoted by something called an OSI Model. Starting from </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify;"><code>Application layer <br> Presentation layer <br> Session layer <br> Transport layer <br> Network layer <br> Data Link <br> Physical layer.</code><br></p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">So feel free to know more about it and don't worry if it seems a bit complex to understand. You can always ask in the comments/send a mail if you have any queries.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                       Hyper Text Markup Language is a scripting language that allows one to create webpages. A website is a collection of such webpages marked in an even orderly fashion. It is written in the form of tags which start with angle brackets around the tag word. eg. <code>&lt;p&gt; , &lt;a&gt; </code> and the ending of that portion is referred with a <code> &lt;/a&gt; </code> and a <code> &lt;/p&gt; </code>. The slash used is a forward slash '/' and not a backward slash '\'. Be careful about it.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">The purpose of a web browser, as discussed is to bring in the webpages from a remote computer (server). HTML5 allows you to put images, audio and video. But firstly before we make a website, we need to know a little more technical details as to how a website is delivered to the user and why on request of a webpage only the homepage is retrieved ? Why not any other page ? For eg. if we go to www.yahoo.com, we see the homepage but not any other page like yahoo groups or something, though all these pages like Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Groups and so on is still there. This happens because of the existance of a page called index.html also called the landing page. Out of all the files on the server, the web browser retrieves this page first when you make the query. So now you guys know how to save your homepage. <br><br>So then, what is HTML5 ? <br>
                        Easily put, HTML5 = HTML + CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) + JS (JavaScript)
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">We'll get to CSS and JS later on as we progress. So don't worry about these two as of now, but just know that something like this exists and is important.</p>
                    <img src="http://petelepage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/gela1.png" alt="">

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">HTML5 is a major revision of HTML, XHTML and HTML DOM. It includes everything you see in your browser, such as text, images, multimedia, web apps, search forms and so on. It has a much more simplified doctype and is easy to understand. But wait, whats a doctype ? You might have figured it out by now, its document type, something that tells the browser what kind of a document it is, if its an HTML1 file for a HTML4 file or an HTML5 file.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;"> So the HTML documents which were previously written before 2009 were mentioned this way so that the browser could understand what exactly to be using.<br>This says that the HTML document is of HTML4.01 written in ENglish and using Strict usage from W3C's rules and regulations. W3C as its generally referred is World Wide Web Consortium is an organization that sets standards for the World Wide Web.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        <code class="hljs xml">
                         &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" 
                         "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;
                        <br>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
 "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"&gt;
                        <br>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"&gt;
                        <br>
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
                        <br>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
                        <br>
This says that the document retrieved is of HTML5 , Simple enough ?<br>
<strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</strong>
                        <br>
                        </code>
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">So lets do an exercise as of now, Take any website of your choice and find out which type of HTML is used in making the website, For this you have to open the source of that particular webpage, so on your firefox browser, go to a website, for example, i'll be taking facebook.com. Go to the page, right click on it and select the option <strong>view source.</strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;"> This will give you a scary screen with code everywhere, something like this.</p>
                    <img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6Ks5cCctzlc/UZciW-B30FI/AAAAAAAAAHI/JUUlaCcBQwo/s640/Source.png" alt="">
                    <p style="text-align:justify;"> All you have to be doing is then look at line 1 and figure it out. So, to end it for the day, Misconceptions about HTML5 are:</p>
                    <ul style="text-align:justify;">
                        <li>HTML is a programming language</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Answer:</strong> No, It is NOT a programming language. Its a scripting language and aids programming.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Its a substitute to Flash.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Answer:</strong> HTML5 does offer audio and video support but with certain limitations. This Flash based website had almost 800 mp3 files; making it a large scale application. The problem lies in the fact that while Mozilla supports .ogg format and chrome/safari supports the .mp3 format, so if the user’s preferred browser is IE8, the Flash Audio Player becomes a necessity. Limited Extensions available on HTML5 mean that the only solution is to convert all audio files into two formats — mp3 and ogg/wave. To convert 800 files into two file formats isn’t just a time consuming process but also increases server storage. We'll get back to file formats soon.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>HTML5 can handle all sorts of animations.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>
    Answer: </strong>No, Not yet. Its ability for 3D animations and running multiple animations is severely limited.
</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Now that you know what HTML5 cannot do, Lets have a look at what it CAN do.
                    <ul style="text-align:justify;">
                        <li>A single application can be created that works on iPad, Windows 8, iPhone etc..,</li>
                        <li>Develop a website that can work on tablets, phones and desktop browsers.</li>
                        <li>Improved website performance and speed.</li>
                        <li>Quicker load time because of implementation of Web Sockets. (don't worry about this)</li>
                        <li>Provides appropriate built in validation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">So thats for day 3, Experiment.</p>

                    <h2 class="content-subhead" id="day4">Day 4 - Beginning Writing the code</h2>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">So, after a few theoretical concepts tackled, lets get to actual work. Building the web. So to write the code, we need something called an HTML editor, generally all Text Editors like Notepad, which comes built in into your Windows operating system, and gedit which comes with your Ubuntu Linux and VI text editor in your Fedora Linux distributions. Well these simple looking notepad type applications can really help build the web and are called Basic text editors, the best part is that they are built in.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So are there any other editors and software for web development ?</strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Yes these are called source text editors, there are some editors which support many programming and scripting languages and come in three ways. Freeware, Opensource and Proprietary software. What exactly is the difference ?</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">A freeware is a type of computer software that is given completely for free for lifetime usage. eg.HTMLKit. An Open source software is a freeware but the complete source code which is used to make the software is also provided. eg. Notepad++. A proprietary software mostly WYSIWYG software is something which one has to buy and use. eg. Adobe Dreamweaver, Microsoft Visual Studio Web Essentials.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">So whats the big difference between these ? Advantages of a source text editor are</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Syntax highlighting.</li>
                        <li>Templates (present in a few proprietary ones).</li>
                        <li>Toolbars and Keyboard shortcuts.</li>
                        <li>Automatic insertion and suggestion of HTML elements.</li>
                        <li>Auto completion.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">An HTML page that is created generally contains a Doctype, which defines the version of HTML used in the document. An HTML element may contain content like text, images, video, body, paragraphs and so on. An HTML element is a set of tags i.e open tag and close tag combination. such as the code as follows.</p>
                    <code class="hljs xml">
                        &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;<br>
                        &lt;html&gt;<br>
                        &lt;head&gt;<br>
                        &lt;title&gt;My First Webpage&lt;/title&gt;<br>
                        &lt;/head&gt;<br>
                        &lt;body&gt;<br>
                        &lt;h1&gt;Webpage&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
                        &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph. So you can keep typing something here. the data between the start and end of this paragaph tag 'p' including the angle brackets is called an HTML element.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
                        &lt;/body&gt;<br>
                        &lt;/html&gt; <br>
                    </code>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Type over the code present on top into your text editor and save it with a filename, say script.html onto your desktop. Note that the <code>.html</code> has to be put in as extension so that your default browser can take care of running this file. Then double click on it, and it'll open the browser running your program. Here my default is Firefox 21 and the execution of the above code gives this output on your screen.</p>
                    <img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W10JF0-Vo4A/UZio58OadzI/AAAAAAAAAHY/jUiMHsly2d8/s640/codebasic1.JPG" alt="">
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">So how is this working, </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The doctype line says that the document is written in HTML5</li>
                        <li>The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag says that this is the start of the HTML code and <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>  marks the end of the HTML code.</li>
                        <li>The  <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> My First Webpage  <code>&lt;/title&gt;</code> tag puts the content My First Webpage between the open and close tags on the title of the browser, In the above figure, the title is present in the tab that is open.</li>
                        <li>The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> shows the heading size.</li>
                        <li>The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> paragraph tag shows how to specify a paragraph. The open and close tags specify one paragraph, to make a new paragraph, a new paragraph tag has to be created below the first paragraph tag.</li>
                        <li>The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags make sure that the information is put in the body of the browser.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">A comment in a programming language or any scripting refers refers to program code that is not executed but is just there for making the life of other programmers who re-program your site easier. Have a look at the source of this webpage and look for something enclosed between</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        <code class="hljs xml">
                            &lt;!-- Comment is placed here. What ever is in between this, will not be executed, meaning that this won't be visible on the webpage when you view it--&gt;
                        </code>
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        We'll get back sometime to know where comments are really used when developing a website or a really long webpage.
                        Do experiment with basic tags that you've learnt today. Also the homework, for you to think over is :
                        <ul>
                            <li>What happens if the HTML code has no DOCTYPE written in the code?</li>
                            <li>What happens if you miss the <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code> and run the code in the browser?</li>
                            <li>What happens when you change the number in from 1 to something else like 2 or 3 or 4 ?</li>
                            <li>What is the maximum number that it can go to ?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        Before we begin today's post, I am really happy to inform you readers that we have another dedicated contributor contributing to the information of the blog from today and hence acting as a web mentor. Thank you Manoj Reddy for helping out. Parts of the following article have been written by Manoj, You can find him <a href="https://www.facebook.com/manoj.reddy.10">here</a>. So starting off with the good news, lets recollect what we learnt previously.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        <ul>
                            <li> HTML documents contains HTML tags and plain text. Tags are used to signal the browser that plain text written in between them need to be interpreted and displayed in a particular way. For example if a new paragraph text need to be displayed on web page, then we need to use the tag that indicates the start of paragraph. For this tag <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is used and end of paragraph is denoted by end tag <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>.</li>
                            <li>A web browser initially finds the HTML version used to design the web page using <!DOCTYPE HTML> To know about DOCTYPE  you can see the previous article.</li>
                            <li>Opening tags and closing tags come in pair like <code>&lt;p&gt; & &lt;/p&gt; , &lt;h1&gt; & &lt;/h1&gt;</code></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>So to design a web page we need to be familiar with regularly used tags. We will be discussing few of them today. What a web page consists of in  general are images, links, menu lists, headings , paragraphs, plain-text written in different styles .We will be discussing the tags used to define these elements.</p>
                    <code class="hljs xml">
                        &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;<br>
                        &lt;html&gt;<br>
                        &lt;head&gt;<br>
                        &lt;title&gt;My First Webpage&lt;/title&gt;<br>
                        &lt;/head&gt;<br>
                        &lt;body&gt;<br>
                        &lt;h1&gt;Heading1&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
                        &lt;h2&gt; Heading2 &lt;/h2&gt;<br>
                        &lt;h3&gt; Heading3&lt;/h3&gt;<br>
                        &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph. So you can keep typing something here. the data between the start and end of this paragraph tag 'p' including the angle brackets is called an HTML element.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
                        &lt;p&gt; second paragraph goes here .                                           You can write second paragraph matter here&lt;/p&gt;<br>
                        &lt;/body&gt;<br>
                        &lt;/html&gt;<br>
                    </code>
                    <p>The web page has a title My First Webpage and the answer to the question that was previously asked, about changing the number in the tag &lt;h1&gt; results in the decreasing font size of these headings. &lt;h1&gt; being the maximum font size for heading and &lt;h6&gt; for the smallest font size. Try experimenting with them. When you run the program in the browser it gives you the following output.</p>
                    <img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C6sBod31Zls/UZm01G7pm1I/AAAAAAAAAHo/xf_7qu_sQ3Q/s640/codebasic1.JPG.png" alt="">
                    <p>So now, I am having a little crazy thought, I want to show largest font and to show smallest font. Is this possible ? Of course yes, We'll look into how the default font sizes can be changed when we will be doing CSS or Cascaded Style Sheets.
                        <br><br>
If you've observed in the code and the output produced, the second paragraph of the code has a really long space between both the sentences in the code but this is not shown on the browser. Disaster right ? Program is not working fine right ? So this brings another thing to know, HTML doesnot consider whitespace (space, backspace, tab) characters when doing the display, it just ignores it.
<br><br>
So two other things for you readers, think about these questions below</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To consider them we need to specify browser not to ignore spaces. For this we need to include tag &lt;pre&gt; at the start of the second paragraph and &lt;/pre&gt; at the end of the paragraph. Now,observe the change in your browser.</li>
                            <li>What happens when we use nested paragraph tags like this one <p>  is there any difference      Check the pattern you get in your browser.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <code class="hljs xml">
                                        &lt;p&gt;some text here.&lt;p&gt;some text here.&lt;/p&gt;  what did you find? &lt;/p&gt;.
                                    </code>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>HTML is a language that is generally used to display data effectively to the user and that's why the design and formatting of a webpage is highly important since it appeals to the user's eye. So now lets look into formatting.</p>
                    <code class="hljs xml">
                        &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;<br>
&lt;html&gt;<br>
&lt;head&gt;<br>
&lt;title&gt;My First Webpage&lt;/title&gt;<br>
&lt;/head&gt;<br>
&lt;body&gt;<br>
&lt;b&gt; text is bold &lt;/b&gt;<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
&lt;i&gt; text is italic &lt;/i&gt;<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
&lt;hr&gt;<br>
&lt;!-- Horizontal Line --&gt;<br>
&lt;strong&gt; says text is strong.what is strong &lt;/stong&gt;<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
&lt;em&gt; almost same as italic right? &lt;/em&gt;<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
&lt;/body&gt;<br>
&lt;/html&gt;<br>
                    </code>
                    <p>So what exactly are bold &lt;b&gt; , italic &lt;i&gt; , strong &lt;strong&gt; and emphasis &lt;em&gt;.</p>
                    <img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3ic_4ij5VaA/UZm6VPseg8I/AAAAAAAAAII/4Jl3wngmq5I/s640/codebasic1.JPG" alt="">
                    <p> Whatever is between the tag &lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt; is used to display text as bold and tag &lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt; used to display text as italic .To write text in next line we use break line tag &lt;br&gt;. This brings in the information to the next line, the more the line breaks you use, the more the number of lines below the information will be displayed. &lt;hr&gt; &lt;!-- Horizontal Line --&gt; As you can notice in the output, there is a horizontal line, this is obtained by the &lt;hr&gt; tag. Strong and bold tags both show the same output type and italic and emphasis also have the same italics, so why should one use strong in HTML5 instead of bold? Why should one use emphasis instead of italics?

The reasons are as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>&lt;strong&gt; &amp; &lt;em&gt; mean that you want the text to be presented on screen in such a way that the reader of your webpage understands that it is important.</li>
                        <li>The &lt;strong&gt; &amp; &lt;em&gt; ymight not make a big difference to regular people but it helps the specially abled to use computers and the internet by using a feature that most neglect, Ease of Access in windows, Narrator in Mac, Text to Speech on Linux. When the webpage is read by this software, it emphasises on the text where it is important because some people can't see a computer but can hear it. This was an effort by Noriko Umeda which was then developed furthur. So we learn that when we design a website, we have to design it in such a way that every person using the internet can understand the contents no matter what the condition. Inspiring isn't it ?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> <strong>What is an HTML Attribute ?</strong><br>
Attribute is modifier of HTML element. They are used to define the size of image, color of the text,back ground color of a table so on. It defines properties.</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
    <li>Attributes provide Additonal Information about a particular tag.</li>
    <li>It is always mentioned in the start tag.</li>
    <li>Attribute names come in name or value pairs. (lets forget about this as of now)</li>
</ul>
                    </p>
                    <p> So lets see how another common thing we see online, Links, are done. This is done with the help of the Anchor tag (&lt;a&gt; tag).</p>
                    <code class="hljs xml">
                        &lt;body&gt;<br>
&lt;h1&gt; Example of re-direct link &lt;/h1&gt;<br>
&lt;a href="http://www.gmail.com"&gt; Gmail &lt;/a&gt;<br>
&lt;/body&gt;<br>
                    </code>
                    <p>lets see how this code works, the href="http://www.gmail.com" redirects the word Gmail on click to that particular website in the same tab of the browser. If you want it to open in a new window or new tab instead of opening in the same tab, you add a target="_blank" to open in a new tab, so the final code for the you to generally use is.
<code class="hljs xml">
&lt;a href="http://www.gmail.com" target="_blank"&gt; Gmail &lt;/a&gt;<br>
&lt;a href="#" target=""&gt; Gmail &lt;/a&gt; <!-- There is no link here and a # targets you to the top of the page -->
</code>
                    </p>
                    <img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yOeZJIKrYTQ/UZnBgDE39zI/AAAAAAAAAIY/nqenM9h2y4I/s640/codebasic1.JPG.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                     Clicking on the Gmail text will take you to Gmail, since Gmail is not located on your server you have to put http:// in the href for files that are already on your server, your href="/server/path/".

In the next day's lesson we'll take care about how to make ordered lists (i.e. 1,2,3...) and un-ordered lists (bullets). So do experiment with whatever you've learnt and improve on the First Web Page replication work by putting a '#' in the links.

                    <!-- Every Article End --> 
 <h2 class="content-subhead" id="day6">Day 6- The Journey of 'Data'</h2>
                     <p style="text-align:justify;">So as you can imagine from the title, there won't be any 'code' today and it'll be mostly theoretical. Today we'll be discussing about how communication takes place between one computer and another, and how information is sent, in detail. This is the journey of data.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p style="text-align:justify;"> Every communication that happens between two computers happens with the help of 14 different layers with 7 layers layers on each computer. A layer can be compared to a real life situation of a train station. There are 7 layers in the OSI model (Open System Interconnect) model. The layers are in the following order in a computer.</p>
               <br>
               <ul>
                    <li>Application layer.</li>
                    <li>Presentation layer.</li>
                    <li>Sessions layer.</li>
                    <li>Transport layer.</li>
                    <li>Network layer.</li>
                    <li>Data link layer.</li>
                    <li>Physical layer.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">So lets analyze the journey of data from one computer to another. First <b>the application layer</b>acts as the window for application processes and users to access networks, compare it to your browser which is an application, the links you click on your screen are the data. Assume this to be the same as a train waiting at a train station, and the data is the cargo its transporting. The application layer packs the data and sends it to the presentation layer. So similarly, the cargo is packed into a train and the train is sent to the next station.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Presentation Layer</b> acts as the translator to the network, it converts data from common readable format to a much well known network format for the computers, such as converting ASCII to EBCDIC. This is similar to making sure that the train driver knows the language of the place where he's going. This layer also provides data compression and data encryption. Encryption is the process of converting the data from a readable format to a more secure format using mathematical and logical equations. This was first done by Julius Caesar. Something that is plainly readable is called 'plain text' and something that is converted into secret code is called 'cipher text'. The process of converting plain text to cipher text is called Encryption and its reverse is called Decryption. The process and Encryption and Decryption together is called 'Cryptography' and is a very important factor to keep you safe online. Julius Caesar converted every document that has to be sent across a war to a +3 character set, so A becomes D, B becomes E and so on and X becomes A. The information that was being sent could never be read by the enemies in case the messenger got caught. Smart right ?</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Sessions Layer</b> is like the traffic police, it checks the data, and puts the safe to move or similar to a kind of police clearance. It's like a toll gate and remembers which train has left and which train has come, it doesn't allow other data to come and destroys it. It is a further layer of security. It keeps count of how long you're online without viewing a page and them times out that page for security reasons. This acts as what is mostly known as Firewall.</p>    
                <br>
                <p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Transport Layer</b> ensures that the messages are delivered error free in sequence and with no losses or duplications. It relieves the higher layers discussed from any concern with the data. This is similar to a police check of the cargo on the train when its going. It tells the driver where to go with the cargo and its duty is to send the trains carrying the information in order. This layer can accept large messages but the layers to follow have message size requirements. The transport layer breaks the information into smaller <b>segments</b> and sends the information to the <b>Network Layer.</b></p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b>The Network Layer</b> converts the segments into <b>packets</b> similar to how the cargo on the train is distributed equally into smaller carriage cars. This layer is like a junction and it has all possible connections through which it sends the data through one particular track/path just like how trains can change path of movement at junction until they reach another junction. The source and destination of the data is added here to the message.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align:justify;"The Data Link Layer provides error free transfer of packets to frames from one computer to another by placing a MAC (Media Access Control) Address to the frame, every computer has its own pre-defined and fixed MAC address on its NIC (Network Interface Card) which cannot be changed like an IP. This then gets converted to <b>bits</b> in the <b>Physical Layer</b> and these bits are sent across hardware medium like Ethernet cables, coaxial cables or optic fibre cables from one computer to another.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">All this takes place at one side (i.e. information senders), the same steps take place in the destination computer in the reverse direction from Physical layer to Data link layer all the way up to the Application layer. The information that was requested is then sent back from the destination computer through the same 7 steps as we discussed in application layer to physical layer order (since now it acts as sender) and at the receiving it goes back from bottom layer to top. To sum up everything so far here is an image.</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify;">So next time you click on a link, This is the long and fast journey the data has to take to send information, request information and retrieve information and show it on your screen. Complex isn't it ? Think about how complex it is to find the computer serving the information in the billions of computers and mobile devices we have in the world. Its worth spending some time thinking about and being amazed by the beauty of the internet.</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify;">So now that you've been through most of the basics, lets look at a few core HTML5 features, the audio and the video tags and their attributes.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align:justify;"> The audio tag is used to place audio elements like songs, music portions etc., HTML5 supports 3 major formats , the .ogg format, the .mp3 format and the .wav format when it comes to audio files.</p>
                <code class="hljs xml">
                 &lt;audio controls&gt;<br>
                 &lt;source src="song1.ogg" type="audio/ogg"&gt;<br>
                 &lt;source src="song2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&gt;<br>
                 &lt;source src="song3.wav" type="audio/wav"&gt;<br>
                 Your browser does not support the audio tag.<br>
                 &lt;/audio&gt;
